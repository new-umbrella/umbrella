## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows the **CLEAN + MVVM** pattern to ensure separation of concerns and modularity.

### **Core Layers**

1. **Presentation Layer (UI & Components)**
2. **ViewModel Layer (State & Business Logic)**
3. **Use Case Layer (Application-Specific Logic)**
4. **Data Layer (APIs, Local Storage, Plugins)**

### **Plugin System Overview**

- Plugins are downloaded as **JavaScript files** with a corresponding **manifest.json**.
- A **sandboxed Node.js runtime** executes plugin logic securely.
- Plugins provide methods that will fetch the media to be handled by the app.

## üîå How to Create a Plugin

### **Plugin Structure**

#### **Each plugin consists of:**

##### plugin.js: The main logic file (Plugin methods to be exported are defined in [ContentService.ts](plugin-example/src/models/ContentService.ts)).

###### **Plugin Info**

- Example of plugin layout can be found in [example-plugin-template.ts](plugin-example/src/example-plugin-template.ts).
- Return types and arguments for methods that must be implemented can be found in [ContentService.ts](plugin-example/src/models/ContentService.ts) (All types are in the [models](plugin-example/src/models) folder).
- Plugin class can implement any number of methods needed, but the only methods that will be ran in the sandbox are the predefined ones in [ContentService.ts](plugin-example/src/models/ContentService.ts).

##### manifest.json: Metadata defining plugin behavior and UI components (Deeplinks should point to this file using the "umbrella://" scheme. Refer to [index.html](plugin-example/test/index.html) and [manifest.json](plugin-example/test/manifest.json).

###### **Manifest Fields**

- sourceType (String): Type of source this manifest file points to (Types are defined in [SourceType.ts](plugin-example/src/models/source/SourceType.ts).
- author (String): The name/alias of the person making this plugin.
- name (String): Name of the plugin you are making.
- version (Int): Version number of the plugin (This will be used when checking for updates).
- description (String): Description of what your plugin does/provides.
- homePageUrl (String): Home page/Root route of the site your deeplink is located.
- iconUrl (String): Profile image url of the author (will be displayed in the Plugin related screens).
- manifestUrl (String): Link to the manifest.json file (This will be used along with the version field for checking for updates).
- pluginUrl (String): Link to your plugin.js file (Used to fetch the code for the the plugin).
- bannerImageUrl (String): Link to the image you want to be dispalyed as the plugin banner (Used in the plugin info view).
- changelog (String): This plugin version's changes from the previous version.
- readme (String): Any special info about/that is needed for using your plugin.
- license (String): License or Description for how or whether or not someone can share, edit, or sell your plugin.

#### **Example Plugin**

For an example of how a plugin file should be structured can be found in [example-plugin-template.ts](plugin-example/src/example-plugin-template.ts). Return types and arguments are defined in [ContentService.ts](plugin-example/src/models/ContentService.ts). You can implement other methods in the plugin class if needed, but all plugins should implement the methods in the [ContentService.ts](plugin-example/src/models/ContentService.ts) file.

### **Registering the Plugin**

1. Upload the plugin.js and manifest.json to a remote server (You can test with the "Live Server" VS Code extension).
2. Create a link to the plugin that points to the manifest.json file with the information to your plugin (Should follow the "umbrella://{url_to_manifest_file" pattern. Example can be found in [index.html](plugin-example/test/index.html)).
3. Click the link on the device that has the app installed and open in the background.
4. Click "Install" on dialog.
5. Check the "Plugins" page to see if your plugin has been installed and is working.

## üîí Security & Sandboxing

- Node.js-Mobile is used to create an isolated execution environment.
- Plugins run in a restricted sandbox with limited access to system resources.
- Data validation ensures plugins conform to expected behavior.
